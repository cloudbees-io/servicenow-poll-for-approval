= CloudBees action: ServiceNow change request poll for approval

Use this functionality to query an existing ServiceNow change request for approval.

== Authentication methods

The ServiceNow action supports both basic and OAuth authentication methods to connect with ServiceNow.

* *Basic authentication*: Provide a ServiceNow URL, a valid username, and a password to connect to the ServiceNow application.
* *OAuth authentication*: In addition to a ServiceNow URL, a valid username, and a password, provide a *ClientId* and *Client Secret*, for generating a bearer access token with an expiration date.
This method is more secure.

== Supported versions

CloudBees has tested and supports the link:https://www.servicenow.com/docs/bundle/xanadu-release-notes/page/release-notes/family-release-notes.html[ServiceNow Xanadu release] for use with these platform actions.
Other versions of ServiceNow may work with the CloudBees platform, but they are not yet supported.
If you are using another version of ServiceNow, submit a feature request with link:https://support.cloudbees.com[CloudBees Support].

The user must provide:

* xref:README.adoc#authentication-methods[Valid credentials] and the ServiceNow host URL.
* The *cr-number* auto-generated during change request creation.
* At least *one* of the following two options to poll for these fields to reach the given values:
** The current state of the change request (specified by `state-field-value`).
** The value of the *approval* field in ServiceNow (specified by `approval-field-value-approved` and `approval-field-value-rejected`).

== Usage examples

The following is an example payload for querying a change request for approval using OAuth-based authentication and both state and approval values:

[source,yaml,role="default-expanded"]
----
      - name: Query ServiceNow CR with state and approval fields
        uses: cloudbees-io/service-now-poll-for-approval@v1
        with:
          url: ${{ vars.SERVICENOW_URL }}
          username: ${{ vars.MY_SERVICENOW_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.MY_SERVICENOW_PASSWORD }}
          client-id: ${{ secrets.MY_CLIENT_ID }}
          client-secret: ${{ secrets.MY_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          cr-number: "Unique ServiceNow-generated number"
          poll-interval: 5
