== Usage examples

The following is an example payload for querying a change request for approval using OAuth-based authentication and both state and approval values:

[source,yaml,role="default-expanded"]
----
      - name: Query ServiceNow CR with state and approval fields
        uses: cloudbees-io/service-now-poll-for-approval@v1
        with:
          url: ${{ vars.SERVICENOW_URL }}
          username: ${{ vars.MY_SERVICENOW_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.MY_SERVICENOW_PASSWORD }}
          client-id: ${{ secrets.MY_CLIENT_ID }}
          client-secret: ${{ secrets.MY_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          cr-number: "Unique ServiceNow-generated number"
          poll-interval: 5
          poll-duration: 120
          state-field-value: "Ready for deploy"
          approval-field-value-approved: approved
          approval-field-value-rejected: rejected

          username: ${{ vars.MY_SERVICENOW_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.MY_SERVICENOW_PASSWORD }}
          cr-number: "Unique ServiceNow-generated number"
          poll-interval: 3
          poll-duration: 60
          state-field-value: "Ready for deploy"
